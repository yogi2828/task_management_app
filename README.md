üöÄ Setup & Installation
Follow these steps to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Flutter SDK installed.

Firebase CLI installed.

A Firebase project set up.

Installation Steps
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/gig_task_manager.git
cd gig_task_manager

Install Flutter dependencies:

flutter pub get

Set up Firebase for your project:

Make sure you have a Firebase project created in the Firebase Console.

Run the FlutterFire configuration command to link your Flutter project to Firebase:

flutterfire configure

Follow the prompts to select your Firebase project and the platforms you want to configure (Android, iOS, Web). This will generate lib/firebase_options.dart.

üî• Firebase Setup (Important!)
For the app to function correctly, especially for task creation and authentication, you MUST configure Firebase Firestore security rules and enable authentication methods.

Firestore Security Rules
For development/testing, you might use permissive rules. However, for production, implement strict rules.

For Testing (Highly INSECURE - Use with Caution!):
Go to your Firebase project -> Firestore Database -> Rules tab, and replace your rules with:

rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // WARNING: This rule allows ANYONE (authenticated or not) to read and write ALL documents
    // in this database. This is EXTREMELY INSECURE and should ONLY be used for temporary testing.
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}

Publish these rules.

Authentication Methods
Go to your Firebase project -> Authentication -> Sign-in method, and enable:

Email/Password

If you plan to implement social logins (Google, Facebook, Apple), you will also need to:

Enable them in Firebase Authentication.

Follow the platform-specific setup guides (e.g., for Google Sign-In, configure OAuth consent screen, client IDs, and SHA-1 fingerprints in Google Cloud Console).
(The current app UI for social login buttons are placeholders and require further code implementation and platform setup.)

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
Run the app:

flutter run

Register a new account using the email and password option.

Log in with your newly created credentials.

You will be directed to the Task List page.

Use the + Floating Action Button to create new tasks.

Tap on existing tasks to edit them.

Swipe left on a task to delete it.

Use the filter chips at the top to sort tasks by priority or status.

Click the logout icon in the AppBar to log out.
